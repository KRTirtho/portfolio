Those were good but at this time these are outdated for almost a decade. I learned web-development & then progressed day by day. At a point I even got internet connection (though it was for my online classes of school before I used mobile-data) which led me towards more accessible world. I learned server technologies then Python, Java & Dart-Flutter, Rust and on and on (more on <Skills> tab). Did a whole lot of small or bigger projects (more on <Projects> tab). Got introduced to Linux world. I used more than 15+ OSs(10+ VM & linux-distributions) after starting coding. Windows is good for general user & gamers or non-technical people but it was really hindering my productivity. So I made the switch to Fedora@31-linux which was big mistake. Then Ubuntu, then Windows then KDE Neon. Last 2-3 months I went deep in desktop applications too. Currently I'm learning Rust & worried about the usage of itðŸ˜…"),
