# PortfolioðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

Its my personal portfolio. Which isn't made with html + css + js at all. Instead Rust's tui-rs was used to create this portfolio. Its tui (Text User Interface) based. This is why its unique than other portfolio people used to build

## Running/Using

Its a binary release thus can't be used in the web though there are other costly ways of showoff this to the world but there are limitations. Thus installing it locally & having fun in your machine is the best & only way

You can either download it from the [release page](https://github.com/KRTirtho/portfolio/releases) & run or just use the following bash code

```bash
# download
$ wget https://github.com/KRTirtho/portfolio/releases/download/v0.1.0/portfolio
# give execution permission
$ chmod +x ./portfolio
$ ./portfolio
```
