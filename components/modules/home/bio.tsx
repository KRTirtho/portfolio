        Hello, I&apos;m Kingkor Roy Tirtho, a seasoned software developer with
        expertise in various tech stacks including{" "}
        <strong>Fullstack web development</strong> and <strong>Flutter</strong>.
        I love to build stuff that help people and solves real world problems. I
        strongly believe in Open source and love to contribute to such projects.
        My goal is to build products that provide pixel perfect, performant
        experiences. With a view to learn and grow, I am always open to new
        opportunities and challenges. That is why I never stop on a single
        framework or language or tool and always adapting to new technologies.
      </p>
